If you have doubt how's it deployed link as it have ```localhost:8000``` in the URL. So it's because reverse proxy itself running on ```port 8000```, that's why. <br>
If the reverse proxy deployed on the ```deployfy.com```, then the link of the deployed website will be in this form ```lazy-whining-insurance.deployfy.com/```, that's how happens in the deployment platform like netlify, vercel, render,... etc.
